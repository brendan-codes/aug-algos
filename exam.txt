1. Take 100% of the exam time! 
 - don’t drop out hours early because you are stuck! 
 - bugs might take a while to find, but they rarely take a long time to fix.

2. Don’t panic!,
	- the only risk of here is you find and expose your weaknesses and where you need additional study.

3. Don’t watch the clock, 
	- try to set alarms for a midway point, a last hour, a last 15 minutes.
	- clock watching kills braincells.

4. Start with what you know!, 
	- save confusing bugs, especially related to black belt features, for the end

5. Don’t hit start until you have your environment and boilerplate ready! 
	- don’t write everything from scratch under exam time 
	- do what you know you’ll need first! (login reg, spring boot, sql, controller, service, repo, models)

6. Follow the exam prompt as a checklist!
	- and double check it against your app before submitting

7. Don’t overthink features!
	- do exactly what the exam asks and no more

8. Remember your training, use your resources! 
	- you’ve done many or most of these features in the last month, 
	- the platform has answers for 100% of the red belt requirements.

9. If you have any problems submitting,
	- send me your github repo or your deployed ip here: bstanton@codingdojo.com

10 If you go over time, submit anyway and you will get a code review,
	- always submit code, i’ll review it and give feedback

11. No matter what, start the exam, take the wireframe, and consider it before monday!! 
	- we WILL be going over it!
	- Make that your primary study material for your retake.

12. Don’t worry about a video
	- just bring it to me when you’re done

13. Follow the bullet list of exam requirements, 
	- if post-it notes on the wireframe itself contradict, the bullet list is the final say

14. Join the lecture room so I can assign you a breakout space
